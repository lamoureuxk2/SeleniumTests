# Dependencies
User must install selenium.

# How to Run
In the src folder, the user can find Junit tests to run on the website. The tests will record their results in the logs folder.

# Adding more tests
Create a new class for the webpage you want to test. Copy the IndexPageTest.java file up until the first @Test. Change the appropriate initial variables to be appropriate for the page you are testing. Specific instructions can be found in the comments at the top of the class.
